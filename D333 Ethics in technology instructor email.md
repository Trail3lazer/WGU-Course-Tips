We want you to be successful with your assessment attempt. While your pass is a great demonstration of progress, be advised that the objective assessment will have different questions and is at a higher difficulty level to the pre-assessment. 
Please proceed to objective assessment preparation only after completing the required reading. Let's make your first attempt, your best attempt! 
Here are our top five tips as you continue to prepare for the OA: 

1.    Review all of our supplemental resources under the 'Course Search' tab: HERE. 

 We highly recommend the study guide to help guide your notes! 

2.    During the OA, take your time! Read each question carefully, as many questions will require applying your knowledge to a situation or scenario. 

3.    When you come across a question that throws you, please please please use what you DO know to work your way through all of those answer choices. I have noticed that students seem to ignore answers they don’t remember or know that they don’t know well – even when they can explain the other 3. 

4.    While reading each OA question, be cautious of responses with definitive wording in them (always, must, never, etc.). For a course like ethics, there are often exceptions to the norm, so absolute/definitive words are major red flags! 

5.    Bring your whiteboard to the OA. Once you begin, write down those key things you are cycling in your mind to not forget. Anything you write down at the beginning of the OA will be harder to second guess later on! 

 

Final Free Tip! Take your time. Remember- go SLOWLY and read each question carefully!
